thank you guys so much for coming in today says everyone have their notes together from the meeting I did you have any questions before you bring in have now because okay awesome so I'm going to rock  thank  I mean this person harder nice to assist you Justin Justin I wind my guide case which I  well  Hey mark %HESITATION  so take a break here next to me  so we called in today to be a part of our students say fast team so that I assembled I had they're all influential members of Jonas life I had just been having a few issues lately we really want to make sure that he's excess water school one of these boxes around quite a bit you know free past couple years so we really want to make sure that he stays here it's awful but first off I do want to go out to dinner just ourselves to you now we all are so why start off I learned a lot in the special education teachers I'm here as an expert and as a reference for everyone how I can help  yeah right LZR Mike I've been on this job at your teacher and I'm here function as the timer for this page okay sound right and I'm Kristin hiker %HESITATION I am the one of the administrators here and I'm also function as  everything went smoothly today  I'm just in Hannah's I am his history teacher and I'm going there for this meeting right and I'm mark Roger and Joan as guidance counselor so I've had some interactions with the public in a class and whenever there's issues that we need to do okay all right so I have my first to start meeting some possible that your son %HESITATION going  so I think that %HESITATION one of the neat things about John is that he is a very very social que I was very very friendly he has a lot of %HESITATION you know by you said kinda with our lunch very outspoken kind of guy he's really vocal very clever you know with his words he finds a lot %HESITATION so there's an intelligence there %HESITATION that I think is maybe not showing it as work and %HESITATION if he is engaged especially in those types of activities he's gonna be a lot more okay yeah and so he does show I should have %HESITATION if given the right opportunity just a huge cost right okay all right I'm back I know we did have a few legal issues that we wanted to specifically address issues  yeah it is great for lacking in the church was showing current I'm willing to do or %HESITATION I wonder if that's because like Mike said he resigned getting engaged %HESITATION maybe activities and doing our  play to the strengths and then maybe my fault %HESITATION but he's also very verbally abusive to other kids %HESITATION because people and places like get a  references to anyone in the classroom %HESITATION and still  yeah yeah yeah  yeah and that sort of place and what I'm seeing from all of its features around campus %HESITATION unfortunately Jonah has been referred %HESITATION to the office and to us from his religious issues multiple times %HESITATION these  that is S. measures would Bali English driving kids around and sort of really sort of enforcing wanting things that have to go his way %HESITATION rather than a proper way %HESITATION and you know this sort of shows a a lack of social skills not really just a lot of inappropriate behavior around so we're just concerned %HESITATION help how often do you talk to him so %HESITATION  on a normal basis I I I see him about twice a month but unfortunately recently it's been a little more often and spend a couple times a week we've been having to have some %HESITATION some discussions and try try try to help the street now this is always this is a relationship with the boys hang around with or what do you know yeah we're not really sure I mean I think that's definitely part of it the kids it he's hanging out with his peer group %HESITATION and you know Johnny is he he he seems to be a natural leader and so he's bringing these get along with them and maybe you know they're bouncing bouncing off each other that their bad behavior and they they seem to get a kick out of it so we like to help them make better choices okay  Hussein out  yeah so yeah it's more about him not realizing the seriousness of what he sad somehow back for others and he is very light hearted  sixteen yeah Joe by a lot of time and other issues yeah find it funny yeah that's the biggest issue I feel and I would like to try and work on  yeah Martin do you have any strategies that  %HESITATION well I know we can be a handful I I I do know that %HESITATION that sets up this is mother died and it's just been really difficult times %HESITATION I I try to keep them engaged %HESITATION %HESITATION I like to focus on things that he's interested in %HESITATION I know he likes before the break dancing thing and %HESITATION watches with videos about that and he likes the music about that %HESITATION %HESITATION %HESITATION but I I know is a leader I know I've seen this happen before where he he %HESITATION can gather a group of people around him so %HESITATION even at home I try to give something in a leadership role to do with %HESITATION in regards to the rest of the failings because he's got brothers sisters  %HESITATION when he when he is asked to do something over your should hold any takes %HESITATION pennies responsive to that right that's but those are the times when he's that's the age you know if you doesn't have anything to think about or do they need to schools often all different directions  well I might suggest based on what you're saying for teachers would be given a leadership role like we have each other  today giving something like this would be a reduction yeah I think I would respond to %HESITATION also  very vocal giving him kind of interactive exhibits where he gets his mind and what he's thinking really yeah this is I think he's a smart kid I just you know it's just like this is difficult right now Martin do you have any ideas for ways to curb the inappropriate vocabulary because I would love to be vocal in the classroom however I do want to appropriate for school %HESITATION  well you know we work yeah we work but he knows that he needs to %HESITATION to stop that %HESITATION it's just that you're getting attention for saying those words if I don't have to wait I think so sometimes I think that my guess is if he had some role in the class or he can be verbal and he knows that what's appropriate let's not forget then he would probably shift over to  yeah he can give an opportunity to speak all right yeah that's something you can definitely keep in mind so I can take some responsibility for that I mean as far as implementing this you know maybe I can start but it's more group work all yeah have maybe within the group he could be the leader of the group and then %HESITATION at the end of the  the intro groups working on the project he comes up in class and you can present that their clothes well I I know they really likes %HESITATION teaching his brothers and sisters about something so maybe you can operate that yeah two into your group thing absolutely so if we just read article summer any just summarize that section and you can present to the class yeah that would be wonderful I think I think I'd be great for  yeah that's sort of the same strategy and math class whatever the rules are that are signed of a facilitator table one of the really good because it'll get him involved yeah and so we have a little bit over science yeah actually that  the thing that is doing very well yeah just like as if it was like his brothers yeah yeah did you have any advice you know as far as did you want to meet with him %HESITATION periodically just see how he's doing as far as behavioral issues go yeah %HESITATION  I'll speak with %HESITATION with this teachers and and we'll follow up periodically definitely it's probably about every other week assuming he does get referred again hopefully we can this'll help sort of motivate him give him a little bit of responsibility research is showing that this is really %HESITATION %HESITATION having responsibility for students something that can help them grow and help them to really sort of step of their former I'm not that you respond to that well I think these are all really great options that we have I am so I definitely do an implement them as soon as possible but again I do want to meet with you again yeah this all come together just to use the words pharmacies ASEAN things working out if there is something that still isn't quite working on can go head to make the switch okay I'm so high so we get your signature real fast okay but it's not the meeting went well  if you have any questions feel free to call anytime okay goodness and  well thank you so much for a great thanks very much I'll
